>## 1. <a name='intro'></a>Introduction to Graphic Design
Graphic design focuses on communicating a message visually. Each project a graphic designer works on will have a unique message and a desired result from that message. The message may be to provide information, invoke thought, sell a product or even stimulate meaningful conversation. Graphic design is all around you. It’s about expressing an idea in the best way using visual story telling. This may sound simple, but it requires problem solving, communication, attentiveness, patience, and most importantly a good grasp of the project’s desired result.

Creating vector images allows you to create clean, beautiful works of art that can be scaled up and down infinitely without ever losing quality.

#### Vectors vs Raster

![VectorsvsRaster](https://www.cia.edu/files/blog/full/image141.jpg)

 Have you ever created an image in **Adobe Photoshop**, and then realized that you should have created it three times larger than you did? You go into Image Adjustments, increase the size, and … oops. The image is now pixelated and looks horrible. If the image was too small to begin with, you’ll need to start all over again. The same does not remain true for **Adobe Illustrator**. Unlike the familiar gif, jpeg, tiff, etc images – known as raster images –  vector images are not made up of a grid of pixels. They are instead created by paths – a combination of a starting point and an ending point with a combination of shapes, angles and lines in-between. These paths relate to each other by mathematical formulas, allowing them to be scaled and rescaled infinitely.

The principles of graphic design are like building blocks. Each one layers on top of the other until you’re left with the foundation for creating something incredible—whether you’re designing a logo, a website, or a custom illustration.

Let's take a look at some of the things you need to know to make your design stand out -
  - Balance
  - Heirarchy
  - Colors
  - Typography

### <a name='Balance'></a>Balance

When it comes to design, you can definitely be creative, but you also have to be balanced.
Proper balance and alignment are core principles of design. Discover how they work and how to use them in concert with other design elements. Structure the elements of your composition to create a design that communicates well. 

[Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDZ9QMA2Bdc) for an informative video about balance in designs.

### <a name='Heirarchy'></a>Heirarchy

When you have multiple elements in a design, you want to make sure you’re giving extra weight visually to your most important message. This is called hierarchy and it can be accomplished in a variety of ways—larger or bolder fonts, placing your most important message physically higher than other pieces of information, or using shapes to frame the focal point. Utilizing this principle in your design starts with your message first and the goals of your design.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlTZ98UXldw) is a good tutorial on why heirarchy is important in designs.

### <a name='Colors'></a>Colors

The color may even be the most important element of a design, because it offers the most powerful visual impact at a single glance. Color is obvious and does not need basic graphic skills to be noticed. The colors you choose for your designs are crucial not only to your overall aesthetic, but to how well your designs connect with your audience (which ultimately drives results).

 - [Find out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byDNMLTuOqI) how colors influence your designs and    help make them more attractive.

### <a name='Typography'></a>Typography

The words you use in your designs are important, but so are the fonts you use to communicate those words. Typography covers everything from font selection to font layout. Not only does it communicate your core message, but it also communicates a lot about who you are and what you’re about. That’s why it’s important to get it right.

   - [Check out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5ZbjSUku44) this informative tutorial to learn why typography is a key element for all your designs.
   - [These](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stOtKLMbP8c&feature=youtu.be) are some cool illustrator tools for typography.
   - [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt15_OclsyI&feature=youtu.be) is how you can create custom type designs on illustrator.

#### <a name='Typesoffonts'></a>Types of Fonts
##### Serif Fonts
Serif fonts have little strokes called serifs attached to the main part of the letter.

![Serif Fonts](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/57a0a50b8d7fb205008d1d0a_08_02_2016/serif.png)

Because of their classic look, they're a good choice for more traditional projects. They're also common in print publications, like magazines and newspapers.

##### Sans Serif Fonts
Sans serif fonts don't have that extra stroke—hence the name, which is French for without serif.

![Sans Serif Fonts](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/57a0a50b8d7fb205008d1d0a_08_02_2016/typo_sans_beret.png)

This style is considered more clean and modern than serif fonts. Also, it tends to be easier to read on computer screens, including smartphones and tablets.
#### <a name='Kerning'></a>Kerning 

##### What is Kerning?

![Kerning](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/57a0a50b8d7fb205008d1d0a_08_02_2016/typo_kerning.png)

In typography, kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between characters in a proportional font, usually to achieve a visually pleasing result. Kerning adjusts the space between individual letter forms, while tracking (letter-spacing) adjusts spacing uniformly over a range of characters.

[Check out](https://type.method.ac/) this awesome website for a fun informative game about kerning.

#### <a name='Tracking'></a>Tracking
Tracking is the overall space between characters, sometimes called character spacing. Most programs let you condense or expand this depending on your needs.

![Tracking](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/57a0a50b8d7fb205008d1d0a_08_02_2016/tracking.png)

In some designs, you might adjust your tracking to create a certain artistic effect. It can also help you fix fonts that are poorly spaced to begin with.

#### <a name='Leading'></a>Leading
Leading (rhymes with wedding) is the space between lines of text, also known as line spacing.

![Leading](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/57a0a50b8d7fb205008d1d0a_08_02_2016/typo_leading.png)

If you're not sure how much line spacing to use, don't fret—the default is usually fine. The goal is to make your text as comfortable to read as possible. Too much or too little spacing, as in the example below, can make things unpleasant for the reader.

### <a name='PenTool'></a>Pen Tool

The Pen Tool creates paths and shapes which can be duplicated and manipulated to create complex selections, masks and objects. Unlike the Brush Tool and Pencil Tools, which “draw” pixels onto your image, the Pen Tool always creates a vector path when used. These paths appear as either Work Paths or Shape Paths in the Paths Panel.

- [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXpnKlUMZQA&feature=youtu.be) is a comprehensive tutorial on using the pen tool.

### <a name='Pathfinder'></a>Pathfinder

 The tool is capable of manipulating shapes and paths that you can use to speed up your workflow. Mastering the tool is important as it lets you create complex shapes very easily.  It makes it easy to combine paths, divide objects, subtract shapes, etc. The pathfinder tool enables you to edit and customize a variety of shapes in a neat and clean way.

 ### <a name='Clippingmask'></a>Clipping Mask

 A clipping mask is an object whose shape masks other artwork so that only areas that lie within the shape are visible—in effect, clipping the artwork to the shape of the mask. The clipping mask and the objects that are masked are called a clipping set.
